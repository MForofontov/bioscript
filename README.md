- 📍 Local alignment (Smith-Waterman) for finding conserved regions
- 🧬 Multiple scoring matrices (BLOSUM62, BLOSUM80, PAM250, DNA)
- ⚡ High-performance dynamic programming (~100k cell updates/sec)
- 🔧 Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- 📦 Zero dependencies, pure TypeScript implementation

### [@bioscript/seq-format](./packages/seq-format)

Comprehensive bioinformatics file format converters and parsers. Features include:

- ✨ GenBank format parsing and FASTA conversion
- 📦 EMBL format support
- 🧬 GFF3/GTF annotation parsing and writing
- 📍 BED format support (BED3, BED6, BED12)
- 🔬 VCF variant call format parsing
- 🎯 SAM alignment format with flag decoding
- 🚀 High-performance O(n) parsers
- 📦 Zero dependencies, pure TypeScript
